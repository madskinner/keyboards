Todo
----

* Fill in the blanks in this README.md file:
  * Fill in the Links information (or delete the line if it doesn't apply)
* Rename the template.keyboard_info file to match your project name (project_name + ".keyboard_info" extension), for example "inuktitut_latin.keyboard_info" for the "inuktitut_latin" keyboard.
  * Complete the information in the .keyboard_info file by filling in data for "language" and "description".
  * replace "zzz" with the BCP 47 code for the language-script-region for which this keyboard is designed, for example: "aak" for Ankave (where no script or region subtag is needed), "ahk-Thai" for Ahka written with the Thai script, or "ti-ET" for Tigrigna as used in Ethiopia. (Keyman BCP 47 support allows a language-script-region triplet. The language code is required: the two-letter ISO 639-1 code, if one exists, or else the three-letter ISO 639-3 (Ethnologue) code. Script and region are optional. See https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags for details.)
  * if this keyboard supports more than one language, separate the codes with commas: "zzz", "qqq"
  * supply a meaningful description for the keyboard; this description will be what website visitors will see when they view the keyboard details and on which they can search
* This should cover many cases, but if the keyboard is more complicated, see: https://help.keyman.com/developer/cloud/keyboard_info/1.0/ for more details of what can be included in the .keyboard_info file, and for examples.
* Finally, remove these TODO items from this file once you have completed them!
